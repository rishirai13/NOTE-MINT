Create an ultra-modern, minimalist, and premium-quality web app named "NOTE-MINT" using pure, clean HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without frameworks. The app must embody a mobile-first mindset and be fully responsive to all device sizes, with pixel-perfect, elegant UI/UX that reflects a product worthy of a high-value, $100,000 app.

Design the app adhering to the following principles:

1. Visual & UI Design:
   - Premium aesthetic with a refined typographic hierarchy using modern, web-safe fonts (Inter, Poppins, Roboto).
   - Soft shadows, smooth rounded corners, and a clean white/light-neutral color palette.
   - Dark/light mode toggle with smooth animated transitions preserving user preference in local/session storage.
   - Subtle micro-interactions and animations for all interactive elements including buttons, theme switch, and modals.
   - Hide native scrollbars in notes list but maintain scroll accessibility.
   - Polished, minimalist landing page presenting "NOTE-MINT" brand with compelling tagline and a clear call to action to open the note-taking interface.
   - Use semantic HTML5 tags (header, nav, main, section, footer) for accessible structure.

2. Core Functionalities:
   - Main interface must include:
     * A fixed top header with bold “NOTE-MINT” branding.
     * An accessible textarea for note-taking with ARIA attributes and placeholder “Write your note here…”.
     * A prominent "Save as PDF" button that instantly exports the current note as a PDF client-side without any server communication (use jsPDF or similar lightweight library).
     * Notes list showing saved notes snippets, timestamp, with preview and delete option, stored only in session memory/local memory for the session duration.
   - No persistent history storage: all data wiped clean once the tab/browser is closed or refreshed.
   - Enable editing of notes in the list before PDF export.
   - Implement robust input sanitization to prevent any injection or malicious script issues.
   - Use modular JavaScript and CSS (BEM naming, CSS custom properties for theming).

3. Usability & Accessibility:
   - Fully keyboard-navigable interface with focus indicators and ARIA landmarks.
   - Follow WCAG AAA color contrast standards.
   - Toast notifications for user feedback on note save, delete, and PDF export with elegant, non-intrusive design.
   - Responsive, accessible layouts that adapt seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

4. Advanced Features:
   - PWA capable with offline support for core functionalities (load app and take notes offline).
   - Search/filter functionality for notes within the session.
   - Code must be scalable with well-structured files and strong inline comments.
   - Conform to HTML/CSS/JS linting with no errors and optimized for best performance and minimal size.

5. Deliverables:
   - Fully operational single-page app with separate, cleanly organized HTML, CSS, and JS files.
   - A streamlined, elegant landing page plus the note-taking interface.
   - README with instructions, manual testing plan, and descriptions of accessibility & security measures.
   - The entire app functions in-browser only, zero data leaks, and zero server interaction.
   - Perfectly matches all specified functionality and ultra-premium design standards.

**Goal:**  
Deliver a blazing-fast, ultra-premium, visually perfect, accessible, and totally private web app for note-taking with seamless PDF export, designed for user privacy and immediate session clearing on tab close. Worth $100,000 in quality and user experience while being a free service to the public.
